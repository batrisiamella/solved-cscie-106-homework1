<ul>

 <li>Refer to the Grade point average Data. The director of admissions of a small college selected 120 students at random from the new freshman class in a study to determine whether a student’s grade point average (GPA) at the end of the freshman year (Y) can be predicted from the ACT test score (X).</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Obtain the least squares estimates of β<sub>0</sub> and β<sub>1</sub>, and state the estimated regression function.</li>

 <li>Plot the estimated regression function and the data. “Does the estimated regression function appear to fit the data well?</li>

 <li>Obtain a point estimate of the mean freshman GPA for students with ACT test score X = 30.</li>

 <li>What is the point estimate of the change in the mean response when the entrance test score increases by one point?</li>

 <li>Obtain the residuals . Do they sum to zero?</li>

 <li>Estimate and . In what units is  expressed?</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Typographical errors shown below are the number of galleys for a manuscript (X) and the dollar cost of correcting typographical errors (Y) in a random sample of recent orders handled by a firm specializing in technical manuscripts. Assume that the regression model Y<sub>i</sub> = β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + is appropriate, with normally distributed independent error terms whose variance is a = 16. (20 pts)</li>

</ul>

<ol start="100">

 <li>Evaluate the likelihood function for β<sub>1</sub> = 1,2, 3,…,100. For which of β<sub>1</sub> values is</li>

</ol>

the likelihood function largest?

<ol>

 <li>The maximum likelihood estimator is . Find the maximum likelihood estimate. Are your results in part (a) consistent with this estimate? (</li>

<ul>

 <li>Refer to the CDI data set. The number of active physicians in a CDI (Y) is</li>

</ul>

expected to be related to<strong> total population, number of hospital beds, and total personal income. </strong>(30 points)




<ol>

 <li>Regress the number of active physicians in turn on each of the three predictor variables. State the estimated regression functions. (10 points)</li>

 <li>Plot the three estimated regression functions and data on separate graphs. Does a linear regression relation appear to provide a good fit for each of the three predictor variables? (10 points)</li>

 <li>Calculate MSE for each of the three predictor variables. Which predictor variable leads to the smallest variability around the fitted regression line? Which variable would you use the estimate Y and why? (10 points)</li>

</ol>




<ul>

 <li>Refer to the CDI data set. Use the number of active physicians as Y and total personal income as X. Select 1,000 random samples of 400 observations, fit the regression model and record β<sub>0</sub> and β<sub>1</sub> for each selected sample. Calculate the mean and variance of β<sub>0</sub> and β<sub>1</sub> based on the 1,000 different regression line and compare against the regression model in question 3 part a. (20 points)</li>
